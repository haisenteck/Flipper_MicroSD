## v0.6.0

Evil Portal and LED control! Thanks @justcallmekoko for adding the commands! See Evil Portal workflow here: https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/evil-portal-workflow

This version also removes the in-app ESP flasher, but don't worry! It's grown up into its own app, where development will continue separately: https://github.com/0xchocolate/flipperzero-esp-flasher


## v0.4.0

Added Signal Monitor (thanks @justcallmekoko!) to support new sigmon command in Marauder v0.10.5: https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/releases

Added keyboard and +5V support from unleashed (thanks @xMasterX!)
