This application allows you to plot a chart showing the relationship between amplitude and frequency, detecting nearby signal sources. If there is a nearby source broadcasting a signal at the observed frequency, the graph will go up sharply.

The app has the following controls:

- The OK button adjusts the width of the spectrum.
- The Up and Down buttons zoom in and out.
- The Left and Right buttons switch between different frequency bands.
