The UART Terminal application allows you to use UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) even without a computer, only with your Flipper Zero:

1. On your Flipper Zero, run the UART Terminal app.
2. Connect your Flipper Zero to a device that uses the UART  protocol for communication.
3. Select the desired communication frequency. After that, you can start reading and writing data directly from the application.
